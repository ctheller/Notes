HTTP Requests In The Browser:

1. Browser Nav

2. Submitting Forms (POST/PUT)

(the above...browser navigates to a new page....AJAX is different).

AJAX: Makes an HTTP request in the background to some route on the server. Server responds with just info (typically in JSON format). NOT html, just info.
-"Asynchronous Javascript And XML"
More often "AJAJ" sort of... use JSON over XML. 


EXAMPLE #1:

$(document).ready(function(){
	
	$.ajax({
		method: 'GET'   <-- default
		url: '/puppies'
	})
	.then(function(puppies){					<-- asynchronous
		puppies.forEach(function(puppy){
			$("#puppies").append("<li>"+puppy.name+"</li>");    <-- to make this performant, we'd save $('#puppies') to a variable before.
		});
	})
	
})

Sidenote: <iframe> is an html element that's like a window into another website.

Data Serializations Formats:

	-Ex: JSON, XML, YAML

	-How real data is conveyed using text in a human-readable format.

	-Used for delivery of data over limited transports, like HTTP.
