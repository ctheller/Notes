you can add as an option:

defaultScope :{
	include: [Place]
}

to a model to have it automatically include it's place location in any db look-up of that model.

Don't use .done and .fail (jQuery promises suck. It's better to do .then() than anything else in an AJAX request. btw, this is a new thing being able to use .then() after an AJAX request!).

HOWEVER, don't use catch(). You can't (just doesn't work yet). Use then(null, ....);

You can't send functions along with JSON. It's NOT Javascript.

Mindset: pretend the server is in Norway... the front and back -ends are TWO completely separate processes.

With "put" and "post" AJAX requests, just include things that you can in req.body instead of req.params.

Don't forget Debugger can be better than console.log!

Sometimes you need to re-query for the included information of brand-new relationships (See solution where we 'PUT' a hotel on day).
