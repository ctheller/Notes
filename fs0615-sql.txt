Database: persists information and makes it accessible (retrievable by code).
* Organized
* Queryable
* Mangeable

DBMS: database management systems
	_one layer and store to access data
	_good for non-technical people to access data

RDBMS (relational):
>data stored in relations (aka tables)
>SQL is how we interact with those tables.
>multi-user multi-threaded
>Programmers choose where these queries return, but not how they're made/executed. 

DFNs:

Database is collection of tables
Table is collection of columns
Duplicate rows not allowed
Rows often have a primary key (ID)
Schema: table's blueprint for data shape/format
SQL: used to create/read/update/delete (CRUD) data from database.

Pivot table: table that links up other tables using their primary keys. 
Foreign Key: a key that relates to the Primary Key of a different table.

One table that has students, a table for schools, and a pivot table (enrollment). Interesting query: find ALL students from Springfield Elementary:
	Join Enrollment Table on StudentID, now join School table with enrollment table based on SchoolID.

	SELECT *
	FROM
		Student 
			INNER JOIN Enrollment ON Student.ID = Enrollment.StudentID     //for every row in table that you're joining. If they match
			INNER JOIN School ON Enrollment.SchoolID = School.id
	WHERE Enrollment.SchoolID = 1

//

Types of Joins:

INNER JOIN : Just intersection of table A and B
OUTER JOIN : everything from both tables A and B but where they don't overlap, set the extras to NULL.
LEFT JOIN: includes everything from A and the overlap of B.
RIGHT JOIN: includes overlap from A and everything from B.
