ADT = abstract datatype

string are immutable. all primitives are. 

Objects are mutable. 

str = "hello";
str[0] = "y";

str still equals "hello", not "yello";

x = 3;
y = x;
x = 4;
//y still equals 3
//but if these were objects, y would change with x. Because with objects you're passing references, not values.

> x = true;
true
> y = x;
true
> x = false;
false
> y
true

> x = ["blue","bell"]
[ 'blue', 'bell' ]
> y = x;
[ 'blue', 'bell' ]
> x.pop()
'bell'
> y
[ 'blue' ]
