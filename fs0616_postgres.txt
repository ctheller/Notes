Postgres: a DBMS- Database Management System

DB is static files. Actual binary data. 

Postgres will sensibly read and write. Brain of the operation. 

Shell (psql) asks DB for stuff, DB produces info and gives it back. 
This Postgres process is a TCP/IP server. Uses the same communication of HTTP over the internet, but uses a different protocol (The Postgres protocol).

Database Driver (pg)(this is javascript (a module): some code that knows how to talk to the Postgres process through TCP/IP and on the other end exposes an API (a bunch of functions or calls) that that environment can use to communicate. PG is a client to the Postgres server. Gives raw table data to the PG driver which then converts it to beautiful objects we can work with. 

PSQL in shell (terminal) lets us also talk to Postgres without having to do it in javascript with our driver.
