GIT!

Working Directory/Working Copy: your project's files and folders.
.git directory

git add:
	* step 1: creates a new blob (binary large object) object in the objects directory of the .git folder 
		This object is a directory with a file in it:
			1. name of the directory.
			2. 

		"git cat-file -p" will cat out the contents of our file. 

	* step 2: creates an entry for the file in the index.
		(can view by doing "git ls-files -s").

git commit:
	1. creates a tree based on the index which represents your project in its current state.
	(another git object)
	2. Creates a commit object (contains a tree, some metadata, and your commit message).
	3. Points the current branch (HEAD file) to your commit object.

When you commit again, the git object will have a parent.

git branch:
	only one step: creates a hash a HEAD.

git checkout{branchName}:
	fuck this lecture. too fast. Look at the damn slides.
