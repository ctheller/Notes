images default to display: inline-block
and by default they will always be as wide as the image. to change this: img {width:100%;}. They also default to maintaining aspect ratio.

(Auto margins don't work on inline-block elements. A stupid thing you must remember)

clearfix:

(.col-lg-4 nested in .row)

.col-lg-4 {
	float: left;
	width: 33%;
}

.row:after {
	content: '';
	display: table;
	clear: both;       <-- like opposite of floating. Clear me away from anything beside me.
}

@mixin clearfix {
	&:after {
		content: '';
		display: table;
		clear: both; 
	}
}


now we can use it for any
.section, .container, .row {
	@include clearfix;
}


Always use box-sizing: border-box (at least almost always)
